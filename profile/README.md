## 🚀 Our Philosophy: Data-Centric AI

We firmly believe that high-quality, high-signal data is the cornerstone of any great AI system. While traditional Model-Centric AI development focuses on iterating on code and algorithms, we champion a shift in focus.

In complex, real-world applications, systematically improving the data often yields more significant and reliable performance gains. All our tools are built around this core principle, designed to help developers efficiently understand, clean, augment, and manage their data to unlock the full potential of AI.

## 🤝 Collaborations

Our academic roots drive our passion for collaboration. We partner with leading institutions to bridge the gap between AI research and real-world impact. Our key collaborations include:

* **Peking University Third Hospital**: We are partnering to develop cutting-edge Medical AI solutions with our `TinyMedical` system, aiming to bring data-centric methodologies to critical healthcare challenges.

---

## ✨ Featured Project: Tiny3D

**[Tiny3D](https://github.com/TinyDataML/Tiny3D)** is our flagship project, a comprehensive production system for 3D object detection services.

It is built with four transformative features:

* **Performance Optimization Engine**: A Data-Centric approach to help users easily achieve high-accuracy and high-speed 3D detection services.
* **One-Line Full Pipeline**: Complete the entire workflow—from dataset editing and model training to compression and deployment—with a single line of code.
* **Fine-grained Data Editing**: Supports granular operations on datasets of any size, down to a single data point.
* **User-Friendly Web Interface**: (Planned) A low-code, visual interface to enhance team collaboration and productivity.
